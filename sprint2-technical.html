  <h1>Margins, Borders and Padding, Oh My</h1>

  <h3>Margins</h3>
  <p>The margin is the space around your element - for example if you have a section of your site for
    photos, the space around the outside of that photos element will be modified using the margins
    property. You might use it to draw attention to the element, or to make the page look less crowded
    and easier to navigate visually. It is important to note that 2 elements with a top and bottom margin
    that meet will 'auto-collapse', or overlap, so you will get 1 margin's space, not both. The margin is
    not a clickable area, it is outside of the element.</p>
  <p>Here's an screenshot of margins at work;</p>

    <figcaption>Fig.1 - The highlighed area is a margin of 40px, outside of the 'sales and marketing' element.
  </figure>


  <h3>Borders</h3>
  <p class="border-section">Borders are pretty self explanatory - they are borders of whatever size and colour you specify, around
    a given element. They can be on all sides of an element, or just selected sides, eg, the bottom only.
    Colours, thicknessess, rounded or squared corners, double lines, dots or dashes, or one side of each, like this.</p>


  <h3>Padding</h3>
  <p>Padding is the cousin of the margin, but goes inside of the element instead. It can center content or
    create space between the outside of an element and the content to make everything more readable.</p>

    <figcaption>Fig.2 - The padding is applied to the bottom of the 'Get in Touch' element.
  </figure>



  <h3>The Box Model</h3>
  <p>These 3 things make up the 'box model' which allows us to think about our elements and their surroundings as boxes
    inside boxes inside boxes, where each box can be used to add space or style in different ways. Every element on a page
    can have its own boxes and so the ways to style your website are endless.</p>
