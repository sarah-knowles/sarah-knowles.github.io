    <h1>Preparing For Bootcamp</h1>

    <h3>Foundation Core Skills</h3>
    <p>Three new things I have learned as part of the Core study are;</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="small-list">I am not good at managing time if I am interested in something.</li>
      <li class="small-list">I can easily talk myself out of trying hard things if I am slightly tired or hungry.</li>
      <li class="small-list">I am nearly always tired or hungry.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Empathy is something I struggle to direct towards myself but always feel for other people. I would imagine it is very useful in the programming world
      since most people will end up working on group projects, or closely with other people and the more we can understand each other the better we can
      work together. For example, knowing that your colleague is having a bad day because of something happening outside of work might mean you
      distribute tasks differently that day, or you offer to take over a tricky part of the work so they can leave early.</p>
    <p>Something that surprised me about the Core learning is that I actually wasn't as interested in it as I thought I'd be,
      because I wanted to be coding instead. I expected to find it very helpful and be a time for me to take a break from filling my
      brain but I found I wanted to skip it quite often.</p>
    <p>The most challenging thing about the core learning was that it was such a big part of each week. It's not an easy thing to skip
      over in a few minutes. It requires actual effort. Because it was mostly after the coding part of the week though, it was usually
      off the back of some success, so that was nice. If I'd had to stop and do it in the middle of a coding challenge I might have said
      much darker things!</p>
    <p>It's obvious that the ability to reflect and be self aware is essential for anyone who wants to work in programming.
      The teamwork required and the fact that it involves a lot of frustration would make a person with low self awareness potentially
      very difficult to work with.</p>
    <p>At times I did think I should be programming not thinking about myself, but that is because it's something I do anyway
      in a less structured way. So it feels like more of the same when there are things I don't understand still that I could
      be working on instead. That said I would call it a 'waste', I did put into words some things I sort of knew about myself and that is helpful
      because I may need to explain that to someone I work with some day and now I know how.</p>

    <h3>Reflecting on my Learning</h3>
    <p>At the end of bootcamp I will be looking for employment in the web development area. Long term I would like to work on projects that
      I feel have real merit or help people in some way, above and beyond the usual websites we use every day. Maybe I
      would like to work for a charity (I previously spent 7+ years working for Hospice and I felt good about my work every day) or a NPO.</p>

    <p>My least favourite thing ever is presenting my work to a group. I don't like the public speaking and I don't like having my thought
      processes on display, and I'm not even sure if I can always explain them very clearly. I feel like this will be
      something I will get a chance to practice during bootcamp...
    </p>

    <p>Looking back, I don't think I realised in Sprint 2 just how hard I was going to find learning Javascript. I had a bit of an idea that it didn't
      come easily to me as I'd seen some before but it has been really hard to just accept that I don't need
      to understand why something works, just that it does work. My Mum said doctors don't know how medicines work, just that they do, and which
      to apply in which case, which is probably a fair comparison. I need to catch myself when I am trying to go down
      those rabbit holes, and say to myself - just find the thing you need and move on, don't dissect it completely and try to figure out why it works
      under the hood.</p>

    <p>During bootcamp I suspect I will be very tired and need to cut back on some other activities to look after myself as well as I can. Learning new
      stuff is quite tiring for me. I usually have only 1 free evening a week but have rearranged things so
      I will have 2. I may need to further decrease my activities as I go to make sure I am getting up each day rested enough for the learning to happen.</p>

    <p>I would like to come out of bootcamp more confident in my ability than I am going in. I would like to contribute equally to group work which is
      harder for me the more people there are in the group. I find one-on-one reasonably managable but 4 or
      more people and I find I don't want to say much. This is about feeling that my ideas are possibly not as good as everyone elses, so they should
      have more airtime than me.</p>

    <p>Something I'm looking forward to is working with other people in small groups or pairs as I miss that when I'm on my own. I'm an introvert
      and couldn't pair code all the time but having someone to chat to and share what you're up to is nice,
      especially when something is annoying.</p>

    <p>I find giving feedback awkward, especially if I have negative points to make. We can call them opportunities for learning or whatever the latest
      trendy term is all day long, but it doesn't change what they are. I don't love receiving it and I
      really don't like giving it. If I could feel like I was sahring some knowledge and not trying to tell someone how to do something that might help.
      Again, I feel like I'll get plenty of practice at this in the next couple of months.</p>

    <p>I have warned everyone I know that there is likely to be ugly-crying at some point. That doesn't bother me; it's part of the process of being
      invested heavily in something. I expect myself to push on though, and come out the other end ready to
      work and put 2020 behind me.</p>

    <p>Other students have been a good source of support and information during the last 5 weeks. Oh, and the internet of course. I will continue
      to use those resources, plus tutors as required.</p>

    <p>I have got better at using my alarms to keep track of time spend on activities and reminding myself to take regular breaks. I will keep using
      that as a method of keeping myself focussed and stopping when I'm not achieving anything.</p>
