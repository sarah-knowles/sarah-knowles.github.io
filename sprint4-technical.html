  <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
  <hr>

  <p>I spent a lot of time getting stuck this week. I found the built-in methods kata very difficult. I am not familiar
    with the built in methods at all and I found them very hard to understand, despite spending time researching them. I had to check the
    sample solutions after several hours because I wasn't getting anywhere and the error messages weren't pointing me in the
    right direction (hopefully they will get easier to understand with practice). </p>
  <p>The first difficult one didn't bother me too much, I was happy to wrestle with it for quite a while and wasn't getting
    too frustrated. Eventually I make some headway through trial and error. But when the next 5 were just as hard I started to lose focus and get cross with it.
    In the end I'm not sure I really learned very much at all. I will come back to it a few times in the next couple of weeks
    and see if I can get some of it to sink in.</p>


  <h3>Problem solving techniques and process:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li class="small-list"><u>Pseudocode</u> - this is a handy way to sort out what you are actually trying to do, and makes the Googling part easier
      but I often don't know how to convert pseudocode into actual code.</li>
    <li class="small-list"><u>Trying something</u> - I end up doing this all the time. It's time consuming but I think I learn best this way, so it's
      time well spent in the end. It's a good feeling watching your code get closer and closer to what you want it to do.</li>
    <li class="small-list"><u>Rubber ducky method</u> - haven't tried it but I do talk to myself a bit.. would be worth a go, again telling the duck
      what you are doing makes you break everything down into simple chunks.</li>
    <li class="small-list"><u>Reading error messages</u> - occasionally make sense, mostly don't. Hoping to get better at picking
      meaning from them as I get to look at a lot of them...</li>
    <li class="small-list"><u>Console.logging</u> - I forget to do this as much as I could. A good way to check everything is working as expected as you
      go.</li>
    <li class="small-list"><u>Googling</u> - totally comfortable with this and spend a lot of time doing it. Essential, I'd never get anywhere without it. Thinking
      about good search terms is useful. Being as specific as possible gets the best results.</li>
    <li class="small-list"><u>Asking your peers for help</u> - I haven't done this yet and to be honest I don't feel all that comfortable doing it.
      It might be that I would be the first that I'm aware of to do so?</li>
    <li class="small-list"><u>Asking coaches for help</u> - also haven't got this stuck yet, although I got closer this week than I have to date.</li>
    <li class="small-list"><u>Improving your process with reflection</u> - Not an especially comfortable thing, certainly not a habit yet. It is not
      much fun to look at your day and think, well I got annoyed and none of what I did today has stuck in my head... So this
      week I have felt like not doing this. I understand that it helps the learning process though, so I've done as much as
      I could cope with.</li>
