Identity & Values
INFP – the mediator. Sounds right. I hate conflict and would really rather 
    everyone just got on nicely and did what was required to get the job done. 
    I like to use my creativity and can be very flexible and lateral in my thinking. 
    I also like a team environment where things feel fair – everyone gets some input 
    and all ideas are given equal airtime.  On the other hand, I find it hard to divorce 
    emotion from feedback sometimes, as a consequence of the level of buy-in that I have 
    when I’m excited about an idea.
My partner agrees, with a sigh. “Yeah, sometimes I think you don’t hear what I’ve actually said, 
    but what you think I’ve said, because it’s like you’re already on the defensive.” 
    Does he want an argument?! Seriously though, he’s right. I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell him that.</p>
It’s hard for me to step back from conflict at work and think ‘Meh, it’s just a job. I get paid 
    and I go home. End of story.’ I will try anything and everything to forge a good working 
    relationship with me colleagues. My last job is an excellent example. My team was small, just 3 
    of us, although the office was around 50 people. One of those people seemed to take an instant 
    dislike to me which I found baffling as I am not aggressive or pushy in any way and therefore 
    pretty much fly under the radar, at least initially. Over the next 12 months I tried all of the 
    ways I could think of to warm her up. Tiny gifts, asking for lots of advice on work matters, 
    inviting her to lunch, ignoring her, nothing seemed to work! All I got back was unpleasantness 
    and eventually bullying. We had a confrontation one day and even that didn’t improve things, just
     made those around us aware there was an issue. At that point I made an official complaint as I 
     had run out of patience.  Whether it’s objectively the right way to do things or not I would 
     probably do the same again because I feel it aligns best with how I see the world. Oh yeah, I’m 
     also stubborn (or determined if you prefer to re-frame things in a more positive light).  So that’s
      fun. And useful too when things aren’t going my way. It’s rare that I will give up or say 
      something is ‘too hard’.
I think a lot about ethical decisions. Really, they are almost all ethical decisions... 
    Who owns the supermarket I shop at? If I go to the NZ owned one, they don’t always have 
    everything I like. So here is an ethical decision; do I buy a different brand and not enjoy it as
    much to keep $ onshore? Drill down some more and you get to who owns the brand that I can buy in 
    the NZ owned supermarket? If that’s going offshore anyway then does it really matter? The answer 
    to which supermarket I shop at changes depending on more practical matters on the day quite often. 
    Traffic, time, how much I want Cadbury hot chocolate... 
This way of thinking is probably a cultural feature of my family and friends, who generally are 
    quite community minded and thoughtful. Hopefully this mindset will be useful in a developer role 
    where it really is a team effort and everyone brings their own quirks and talents to the project. 
    If not, I’ll do a typical INFP move and daydream up a better one.
