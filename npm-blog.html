    <h1>Node Package Manger</h1>
    <hr />

    <p>
      Like it says on the box, a command line package manager for projects that
      use Node.js. Npm creates a package.json file that will contain some meta-type data about the project
      (typically a name, version, description and license) and list all the
      packages the project relies on to work, plus any packages the packages
      rely on plus any packages those packages... Anyway...
    </p>
    <p>
      The dependencies are split into 2 groups inside the package.json object;
      devDependencies, and dependencies for production. These appear as a
      key/value pair with the value being the version (or the range
      of versions) that is best for this project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The package.json object also includes a script property to automate the
      repetitive tasks during development. Essentially they are just terminal
      commands or shortcuts that allow you to write your own scripts to run
      different modules, specifically for use in the current project. There are
      also some built in scripts like 'npm start' which kicks off
      whatever module is listed next to 'start' in the package.json.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically you will use the terminal to install packages, and to run npm
      commands. See below for some useful commands.
    </p>

    <h3>Commands</h3>

    <ul>
      <li class="small-list">
        <u>npm init</u>  Initialises a project, creates a package.json file in
        the current directory
      </li>
      <li class="small-list">
        <u>npm init --yes</u>  As above except it will not ask for the project details
        but use default values instead.
      </li>
      <li class="small-list">
        <u>npm install OR npm i <code> &lt;module&gt; </code></u>  Installs the
        required packages, and their required packages etc to the node_modules
        folder. Will use the most recent version unless otherwise specified.
      </li>
      <li class="small-list">
        <u>npm install --save</u>  The save flag will enter the module to your
        package.json as a dependency.
      </li>
      <li class="small-list">
        <u>npm install --save-dev</u>  Saves the module and enters it in the
        devdependencies section of your package.json. This is likely to be your
        testing library, a local server etc, things that you need for
        development but not while the the app is running.
      </li>
      <li class="small-list">
        <u>npm install --global</u>  Installs modules globally, defaults to a
        system directory.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tricks</h3>
    <p>
      There are a few tricks for using npm efficiently via built in features,
      for example you can open the github repo for a package by running the 'npm
      repo &lt;package &gt;' command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another useful command is 'npm prune' which will check your node_modules
      folder for any modules that don't appear in your package.json, and remove
      any you didn't manually add or --save.
    </p>

    <p>NPM is a powerful tool, and worth getting to know better.</p>
