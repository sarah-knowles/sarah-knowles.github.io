    <h1>Emotional vs Intellectual Intelligence</h1>

<hr>

    <p>My feeling is that IQ is essentially something that you are born with. You can train it or neglect it but
        it's unlikely to change more than a small amount in either direction. Fortunately Emotional intelligence
        seems to be the more sought-after quality by employers, who I imagine think along the lines of "I can teach
         you to do the thing but I can't teach you not to be an ass".  And I think EQ can be developed. Lucky.</p>
    <p>Intellectual intelligence is knowing the finer details of how snails reproduce, and Emotional intelligence is knowing that the lunch
        table doesn't want to hear about it. It's about knowing people, not facts. That includes and likely starts with yourself.
        Why does that particular feeling get invoked by that trigger? Why might someone else react in an unexpected way to a
        story or a joke? Someone with strong emotional intelligence can probably answer these questions, or at least have a
        bit of a guess.</p>
    <p>Since the majority of us will be required to work as part of a team, this sort of ability is important. A team gets better
        as they get tighter, and if everyone can know their own strengths and weaknesses then the whole team benefits.</p>
    <p>So, did you tell the lunch room about snails? OK, here are some tips for training your EQ muscles;
        <ul>
            <li class="small-list">Self Knowledge</li>
            <li class="small-list">Attention training - aka meditation and/or mindfulness</li>
            <li class="small-list">Good habits</li>
        </ul>
    All right, let's start with the nutty-looking one, meditation. I used to think it was exclusively for the type of people who
    attend women's retreats or post terrible 'inspirational' quotes on Facebook all day. I was wrong. I have struggled my whole life with mental health
    issues and during one of those times when things were wobbly I decided to give meditation a try, because I couldn't switch my brain off at night
    and I was so, so tired. So, melatonin and meditation (and I'd be lying if there wasn't a wee bit of vodka at first) and amazingly I slept! Not all night, but enough! So I changed my opinion.
    Once I got well again, I kept doing it. Every night at bedtime, just a short 5 mins if I'm already sleepy, or 20 mins if I'm really wide awake.
    I really believe it helps me stay well.</p>
    <p>Mindfulness is not the same as mindlessness. It's complete focus on a task, not complete absence from the
        moment. Possibly it's best feature is that you do a better job of whatever you are doing, but it also has the side
    effect of keeping anxiety (worry about the future) and depression (dwelling on the past) from having any air time.</p>
    <p>Self knowledge is your answer to the question "What are you like?" You come to know this through examining your motives and reactions and
        through being really honest about the results of that introspection. Knowing for example that you deal with frustration best by
    taking a short break and doing something unrelated for 15 minutes is an enormously useful thing. No more tantrums! Less meetings with HR! Success!</p>
    <br>
    <p>The point of this really comes down to being an easier person to work with and a more engaged member of the team, and I know that's something I would be happy to be.</p>
