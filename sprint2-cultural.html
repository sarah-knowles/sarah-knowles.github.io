  <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

  <p>When I grow up I would like to be able to create things. But I also like to be warm and dry,
    so I’ve selected web development as my medium instead of building or landscaping or other less
    comfy possibilities. I can see already that it will challenge me in interesting ways but be
    extremely rewarding when the finished product is something I can be proud of. This course is
    going to require me to push through some resistance when things get hard but because the learning
    curve is so steep, I can’t just brute force it. I will need to take breaks and review the things
    that are tricky and make sure I actually understand them. Learning by rote will not work here...
    On the plus side, if I find something interesting then pouring time into it is an easy proposition.
    The issue then will be the stopping part.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, I have time on my side; there is very little in the course of a working week that
    requires my attention right now, so I expect to spend around 40hrs a week on the foundations
    material, including extra work on the sticky bits, and I can work free of distractions for as
    much of the day as I need.</p>

  <p>I think if I can’t understand something after 3 attempts, then I will need to suck it up and ask
  for help. Spoiler alert, I’m rubbish at that. The course outline is broken down into sprints,
  and then further broken down within that so each part can be tackled in turn. The appropriate
  amount of time is suggested – I am going to set alarms using these times as I have not easily got
  into the habit of keeping an eye on these.</p>
  <p>The tutors and facilitators are presumably keeping an eye on us! If we look like we are falling
  behind or are really lost we know how to get in touch, and I expect they will keep us on track
  if we wander too far.</p>
