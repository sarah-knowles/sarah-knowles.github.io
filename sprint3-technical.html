    <h1>Javascript</h1>
    <p>I have previously used the example of a website being like a house, where HTML is 
      the bones (the floorboards, the gib walls, the roof). Then the interior designer shows up, aka 
      CSS, and paints things and hangs curtains to make it look nice and feel like a home. The 
      relationship between the two is probably still able to be thought of in the same analogy; the builder 
      and the designer need to know a bit about what the other is doing, as in, they need to be linked.
      But they don't need too much detail. Just some common phrases (bathroom, master bedroom, or h1, 
      .footer-item for example). </p>  
        
    <p>A useful way to think about control flow and loops might be to imagine 
      that you are putting shoes and socks on. The socks need to happen first 
      (I mean, you do you, but for this example lets assume you want socks UNDER shoes..). 
      So you need to control the flow of activities to make sure they happen in the right order, 
      and you need 2 socks before 2 shoes. You can use a <em>for loop</em> that says 'while I have 
      less than 2 socks on, add more socks'. Same again for the shoes. That way they happen in 
      the correct order, the specified number of times.</p>

    <p>In  Javascript, data can be stored as an array or as an object. An array looks like this - 
      var pets = ["dog", "cat", "pig", "monkey"]. Essentially it is a list, and can be accessed using either bracket 
      or dot notation but I think dot notation looks cleaner. A special type of array is an object and it 
      looks like this - var snacks = {chips: "Salt & Vinegar", chocolate: 5, lettuce: false};
      These properties can be accessed using dot notation also.</p> 
    <p>The difference between arrays and objects seems to come down to howe you intend to use the stored data. If you 
      are going to need to insert more data at random points, an object looks like the way to go since it doesn't store data 
      in any specific order, it basically throws all the items in a box, as opposed to filing them strictly like an array does.</p> 

    <p>Javascript uses functions to do things, which are exactly what they sound like - some instructions for what
      to do when certain conditions are met. They can be really basic and do a simple thing like add 2 numbers together and 
      return a total, or they can be complex and layers deep, where they call themselves and loop (like the socks thing) 
      for any number of iterations. A word of caution... make sure you do tell it when to stop. Otherwise your browser will 
      eventually crash. Not gonna lie, I did this too many times.</p>

    <p>The DOM is the Document Object Model, and is essentially a way to think about your webpage as it 
      is accessed by all the languages you have used to create and manipulate it. It could be 
      represented by a tree - the trunk is the document, and branching off that are the elements
      of your page, then branching off from those are the blocks of text, or links, or images. Each point is
      known as a node. Every part of this can be changed using a scripting language like Javascript. You might 
      like to change the colour of your text after 20 seconds, or make a slideshow of pictures start after the 
      page has loaded. You can get access to the DOM and play around with it via the right click and inspect option, 
      or by opening Developer tools. From there you can change aspects of the locally stored copy of a page. Example; 
      yesterday the Herald was a bit too gleeful about the Kardashians no longer being on tv. My sister was appalled. 
      I was highly amused. Simple things!</p>
