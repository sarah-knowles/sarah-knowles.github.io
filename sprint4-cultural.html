  <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
  <hr>
  <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
  <p>Our brains can rewire themselves, literally changing in structure, making new connections and forming new neural
    pathways in order to learn new things. This ability is Neuroplasticity at work. And, curiously, our brains are actually
    better at doing so when we know this information.</p>
  <p class="list-intro">Strange facts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="small-list"> ⦁ Physical activity and good physical fitness can prevent or slow the normal age-related
      neuronal death and damage to the hippocampus, and even increase the volume of the hippocampus (Niemann et al., 2014);
    </li>
    <li class="small-list"> ⦁ Chronic insomnia is associated with atrophy (neuronal death and damage) in the hippocampus,
      while adequate sleep may enhance neurogenesis (Joo et al., 2014).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Taking the above into account, the best things we can do for our own neural plasticity are to get enough sleep, exercise
    and then learn new things, especially things that require some physical activity like playing an instrument or learning
    a language (ie not just learning facts by rote).</p>

  <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
  <p>Growth mindset is knowing that innate ability is not the only factor in success in a particular area. We can change our
    skills through effort, despite having no natural ability for a particular skill. It requires accepting that failure will
    happen but is an opportunity to learn; that the process of learning is the true goal, not the end result; that hard work
    is more valuable than inherant ability.
  <p>I think web development would be an impossibility without a growth mindset; there is no way that anyone could do it without
    making mistakes and I can't imagine too many people start out with a natural talent for it. Early on I realised I was
    going to have to accept that there were many errors to come and that the only way to learn how to do this new thing was
    to not accept that my ability is limited by anything other than my willingness to keep learning. So reading about growth
    mindset was quite reassuring; there is some research behind the conclusion I came to and it looks like it works!</p>

  <p><em>'A person with a growth mindset believes that he or she can get smarter, better, or more skilled at something
      through sustained effort—which is exactly what neuroplasticity tells us. You might say that a growth mindset is simply
      accepting the idea of neuroplasticity on a broad level!'</em> (positivepsychology.com n.d)</p>
